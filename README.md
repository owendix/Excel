# Excel-forgotten-lock-combination
A friend forgot his lock combination, a 4-letter word, each letter with 10 possible values.
He was sure it was a valid word, but a rare one, not in their online list.

I printed all possibilities then highlighted those matching a self-modified abridged dictionary.
Because the dictionary was abridged, I included those letter combinations that didn't match the dictionary, 
in case I missed a possibile modificaiton. 
First, I found dictionary words that fit these combinations, but these were mostly singular words.
Then found those with three letters and added an 'S' (which was a possible last letter), and 
words that ended in 'E' and changed it to 'Y' (another possible last letter). 

I had excel highlight those in my modified list of possible words, and sorted based on the categories 
of words above, for ease of use. Last I heard, he had still not found the correct word.
